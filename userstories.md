#Sgt Belly and the Vets User Stories

###Sgt. Belly has found out throughout his military career there's a lack of support when seeking information and advice for Veterans upon transitioning out of the military.  As a student at Code Fellows,  Sgt. Belly and his team is looking to create a website that will provide continual support and updates for Vets like himself that will enable a happy and healthy life for the vets, their family and community.
  
##As the Vet/User:
  1. I want to navigate through an app that is enjoyable and easy to use. I want to know what my choices are, where I need to click and any other clear instructions so I'm not wondering what I need to do or where I need to go. 
  2. I want to be able to use a navigation tool that will help me select from the areas I am interested in getting more information and resources about without getting lost.   
  3. I want to know that my inquiry will be saved and the results of my choices I've selected displayed on one page.   
  4. I want to be able to come back to the site and view updates and new features.  
  5. I want to know that my participation from the site is making an actual impact so that the site can continue to reflect up to date services and features to my likes, interests and needs.

  
##As the Developer:
  1. I want to build an app that displays up to date information about the resources included but not limited to and for the Vets noted below:
		a. Health and Wellness
		b. Education
		c. Financial and Legal services
		d. Community Organizations
		e. Employment and Homelessness
	
  2. I want to display a control box/form on the main page that will enable the user to make a selection which will help direct the user to the designated field based on the questions answered.  
  3. I want to store the data from the questionaire/form in the local storage and tabulate the data from the form to display the results on single page.  
  4. I want to display an about-me page of the team that helped make this site possible and stretch goals for updates/features.  
  5. I want the look and feel of the app to be appealing, fun and informative for the vets, their family and supporting community at large.
